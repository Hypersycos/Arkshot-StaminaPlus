# Arkshot-StaminaPlus
Allows changing the stamina costs of Arkshot (Steam ID 468800). Requires BepinEx, and only affects the local client. I plan to add server-authoritative values in the future, but for now play nice.

# Installation
## Prerequisites
The only requirement is BepInEx. The plugin was developed with [5.4.21](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.21/), so if in doubt use that. Make sure to download the 32-bit / x86 edition. Further instructions can be found [here](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html). Arkshot also requires the alternative endpoint, detailed [here](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/troubleshooting.html#change-the-entry-point-1)

## Plugin
Download the [latest dll](https://github.com/Hypersycos/Arkshot-StaminaPlus/releases/latest/download/StaminaPlus.dll) and put it in Arkshot/BepInEx/plugins. After an initial run, the config file should be accessible in BepInEx/config.
